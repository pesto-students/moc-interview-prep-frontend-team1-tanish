# Technology Stack

  

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:


- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- [Redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

## Tools and Libraries

-   [Redux-Tool-Kit] - State Management
-   [Sentry] - Error Tracking
-   [Cypress] - End to End testing

## [](https://github.com/pesto-students/mock-prep-n11-eta2-fe#api-integrations)API Integrations

-   RazorPay - Payments
-   Calendly - Slot Booking

## [](https://github.com/pesto-students/mock-prep-n11-eta2-fe#mobile-responsive)Mobile Responsive

-   Fits to Mobile Screen
-   Fits to Tab Screen - Ipad
-   Fits to Desktop
